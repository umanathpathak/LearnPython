Task3:
Ask a number from the user. If that number is same as today's date then raise a user defined exception 'SameDateError' and print a message
'You are Lucky winner. The number you entered is today's date.'

Task4:
Read a number from the user. Add 10 to that number. It is possible that user may have entered a string. 
Raise an exception if it is string.
Whether it is number or string, print the number/string user has entered at the end of the error message.

    num = input("Please enter a number: ")
    num1 = int(num) + 10
except ValueError:
