#Mathamatical function with int and float

print(x1+x2)    #addition for int/float is arithmatic addition
print(x1-x2) 
print(x1*x2)
print(x1/x2)    #division, in python 3 the o/p is always a float number
print(x1//x2)   #python 2 equivalent division, only intger part is returned

print(x1%x2)    #module/reminder

x1 = x1 + 9     #self addition
x1 += 9         #self addition, same as above expression
