#Our task is to create a function to validate the email address. 
#Let's first understand few valid email addresses. 
#myname.nickname@gmail.com
#superdupercool@yahoo.com
#pythonistgeek@santabnata.com

#All of these are valid email addresses. 

#Now lets see invalid email addresses:
#rahulgandhi_pappu.com@
#mylifemyrules@gmail@com
#iamsupercool@yahoo

#Why you say above 3 are inalid email addresses?

#Because they are not following the rules to make them a valid address. What are those rules?

#that email address should cotain some name, followed by @, followed by some name, followed by '.' and then some name.

#somename@url.extension

#Now lets write a function which will do the same thing:

#The first line will be def and then function name. Our function will have one argument, the string which we will validate.
def check_valid(email):
    
    
#Now it should contain atleast one '@' and '.'. So lets first split our string by '@'
#the first part will be our username and 2nd will be the URL.
    try:
        username, url = email.split("@")
        
#Now URL should have atleast one '.'. Because '.' should come only after '@'. 
#Lets call first part as Website and 2nd part as extension.
        website, extension = url.split(".")
    except ValueError:
        return False

#Now for our username, lets see whether it is valid username or not. 
#Valid user name contains characters [a-z], numbers [0-9], and '-','_' and '.'.

#We have isalnum function to check whether string is alpha numeric.
#But we also have '-', '_' and '.'. so Lets first replace these 3 chanracter by Empty string and thenc check with isalnum().
#If it is not followed then our string is not valid, and return false in that case.
    if username.replace("-", "").replace("_", "").replace(".","").isalnum() is False:
        return False
        
#if now check website is alphanumeric or not. Website can not even have '.' or '-' or '_'.. So we can simply chek with isalnum().
    elif website.isalnum() is False:
        return False
        
#Now extension's turn. Extension should be alphabatic only and length should be less than 3.
    elif len(extension) > 3 and extension.isalpha():
        return False
    else:
        
#if all above rules are passes then it is a valid email address.
        return True

#So the full function will be like below:
def check_valid(email):
    try:
        username, url = email.split("@")
        website, extension = url.split(".")
    except ValueError:
        return False
    
    if username.replace("-", "").replace("_", "").isalnum() is False:
        return False
    elif website.isalnum() is False:
        return False
    elif len(extension) > 3:
        return False
    else:
        return True
        
        

#Now lets test it.
#TO make it dynamic lets ask the email address from user using input()
    
email = input()
valid = check_valid(email)

#This will return True if the email id is valie else return False.
