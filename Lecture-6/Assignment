Task1:
#Create a function to swap the case of the string. If it upper case then convert it to lower case and vice versa.


Task2:
Convert the above function to lambda function.


Task3:
Create a lambda function to reverse a string.


Task4:
use the above crete created lambda function and apply it to below list:
['Aasopalav', 'TejeT' 'Coconut', 'PopoP' 'Pipal', 'Apple', 'Juice', 'AmomA']

Use reduce function to add the above output and make a single string.
Output should be: 'TejeT PopoP AmomA'


Task7:
Use reduce function to get the multiplication of the below list:
l = [4,7,2,9,4,5,3,5]
