Task1:
Import pandas as pd.

Task2:
Read Salaries.csv as a dataframe called sal.

Task3:
Check the head of the DataFrame.
It should look like this:

Task4:
Use the .info() method to find out how many entries there are.

Task5:
What is the average BasePay ?

Task6:
What is the highest amount of OvertimePay in the dataset ?


Task7:
What is the job title of JOSEPH DRISCOLL ? Note: Use all caps, otherwise you may get an answer that doesn't match up (there is also a lowercase Joseph Driscoll).

Task8:
How much does JOSEPH DRISCOLL make (including benefits)?

Task9:
What is the name of highest paid person (including benefits)?


Task10:
What is the name of lowest paid person (including benefits)? Do you notice something strange about how much he or she is paid?


Task11:
What was the average (mean) BasePay of all employees per year? (2011-2014) ?


Task12:
How many unique job titles are there?


Task13:
What are the top 5 most common jobs?


Task14:
How many Job Titles were represented by only one person in 2013? (e.g. Job Titles with only one occurence in 2013?)


Task15:
How many people have the word Chief in their job title? (This is pretty tricky)


Task16:
Is there a correlation between length of the Job Title string and Salary?

It should give something like this:
			title_len	TotalPayBenefits
title_len		1.000000	-0.036878
TotalPayBenefits	-0.036878	1.000000
