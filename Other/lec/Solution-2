Task1:
Create a regular expression for checking valid email id.

import re

email_id = " ankitagrawal579@gmail.com"
pattern = "^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9._-]{5,}@[a-zA-Z0-9]{3,}.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}$"   #'^' at the start of RE is to specify the start of the string, '$' is to specify the end of the string.

s = re.match(pattern,email_id)
try:
    if s : print("valid email id")
    else: print("invalid email id")
except:
    print("invalid email id")



Task2:
Create a regex to check for valid phone number.

mob = "9988899000"
pattern = "^[6-9][\d]{9}$"

s = re.search(pattern,mob)              #instead of using match, I am using search, just another way of checking it, Search is much flexible.

try:
    if s : print("valid mobile number")
    else: print("invalid mobile number")
except:
    print("invalid mobile number")
    
    
    
Task3:
Create a regex to check for valid vehicle number. Example of valid vehicle number is: XX-99-X-9999

veh = "XX-99-X-9999"
pattern = r"[\w]{2}[-][\d]{2}[-][\w][-][\d]{4}"
pattern = r"\w\w-\d\d-\w-\d\d\d\d$"

s = re.match(pattern,veh)
try:
    if s : print("valid vehicle number")
    else: print("invalid vehicle number")
except:
    print("invalid vehicle number")


Task4:
Create a regular expression to check for two times 'Ram' in the given string. 
If the string doesn't contain two times 'Ram', it is invalid string.

For example, 
"Ram Mandir is the next stop after Goregaon. Jai Shree Ram."    - this is valid string. Because it contains two time Ram.
"Superme Court is to decide on Ram Mandir verdict."             - this is invalid. as it contains only one time Ram.
"Ramamyan is written on Shree Ram".                             - again a avlid string, as Ram appears twice.

st = "Ramamyan is written on Shree Ram"
pattern = "Ram"

s = re.findall(pattern,st)

try:
    if len(s) >= 2 : print("valid string")
    else: print("invalid string")
except:
    print("invalid string")


Task5:
Check for the given string has "numeric digit always followed by character" pattern. Space is not allowed after numeric digit. Only a character.
For example, 
"I want to say 1thing to you."  - is valid string. 1 is followed by 't'.
"I want to say 1 thing to you."  - is invalid string, 1 is followed by space, not a character.

st = "I want to say 1thing to you."
pattern = r"[a-zA-Z ]*[[\d][a-zA-Z]+]*[a-zA-Z ]*"   #any character or space + (digit followed by any number of character) * repeat + any character or space

s = re.match(pattern,st)      

try:
    if s : print("valid string")
    else: print("invalid string")
except:
    print("invalid string")


Task6:
Extend the above regex to check for such pattern:    X9W4B7H8
Character Numeric Character Numeric..........
It will always start with a character (A-Z)

Hint: you need to use '[[' and '\w' and '\d' in your pattern. Also check for start() and end().

st = "X9W4B7H8"
pattern = r"^[[a-zA-Z][0-9]]*$"   

s = re.match(pattern,st)      

try:
    if s : print("valid string")
    else: print("invalid string")
except:
    print("invalid string")


Task7:
Write a regex to validate a new username. Criteria for a valid username is as follows:
It should start with an English alphabet followed by alphanumeric characters.
No special characters allowed
Username length should be at least 3 and should not exceed 20.

st = "RAjesh1234asfsd^afsf"
pattern = r"[a-zA-z][a-zA-Z0-9]{2,19}$"   

s = re.match(pattern,st)      

try:
    if s : print("valid username")
    else: print("invalid username")
except:
    print("invalid username")


'''
Task8:
Split given text based on given pattern: '#@#'

"I love python#@#regular#@#expression"
should return ["I love python","regular","expression"]
'''

st = "I love python#@#regular#@#expression"
pattern = '#@#'

l = re.split(pattern,st)
l
