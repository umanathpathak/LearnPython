#The best place to start with Machine Learning is to start with Titanic Problem.

#Use below link to get the dataset 'train.csv':
#https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

#Your task is to understand data using different methods of python.
#Also use kernal tab on the above URL to understand how other people are exploring data.

#Some data Exploratory code is as below:

import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv(r'C:\Users\ankit\Downloads\titanic_train.csv')

data.index
data.columns

total = data.groupby('Pclass')['Survived'].count()
total

survived = data.groupby('Pclass')['Survived'].sum()

df = pd.DataFrame(data=total)
df.columns = ['total']
df['survived'] = survived
df['died'] = df['total'] - df['survived']
df

df['P%survived'] = df['survived']*100/df['total']
df


data.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True)
